# PythonWeb Installer Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the PythonWeb Installer project.

## Python Style Guide

The PythonWeb Installer project follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) with some additional project-specific guidelines.

### General Guidelines

1. **Code Formatting**
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
   - Maximum line length of 100 characters
   - Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
   - Use consistent naming conventions

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - `snake_case` for variables, functions, and methods
   - `PascalCase` for classes
   - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
   - Prefix private methods and variables with a single underscore (_)

3. **Documentation**
   - All modules, classes, and functions must have docstrings
   - Use Google-style docstrings format
   - Include type hints for function parameters and return values

4. **Imports**
   - Group imports in the following order:
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Third-party library imports
     3. Local application imports
   - Sort imports alphabetically within each group
   - Use absolute imports rather than relative imports

5. **Error Handling**
   - Use specific exception types rather than catching all exceptions
   - Always log exceptions with appropriate context
   - Provide meaningful error messages

## Code Organization

1. **File Structure**
   - Keep files under 300 lines of code
   - One class per file (with exceptions for closely related helper classes)
   - Group related functionality into modules

2. **Function and Method Guidelines**
   - Functions should do one thing and do it well
   - Keep functions under 50 lines where possible
   - Use descriptive function names that indicate what the function does

3. **Class Guidelines**
   - Follow the single responsibility principle
   - Use composition over inheritance where appropriate
   - Implement proper encapsulation

## Testing Standards

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Minimum 80% test coverage for all code
   - 100% coverage for critical components
   - Tests should be independent and repeatable

2. **Test Organization**
   - Unit tests should be in the `tests/unit` directory
   - Integration tests should be in the `tests/integration` directory
   - Functional tests should be in the `tests/functional` directory

3. **Test Naming**
   - Test files should be named `test_<module_name>.py`
   - Test classes should be named `Test<ClassBeingTested>`
   - Test methods should be named `test_<functionality_being_tested>`

## Documentation Standards

1. **Code Documentation**
   - All public APIs must be documented
   - Include examples in docstrings for complex functions
   - Update documentation when changing code

2. **Project Documentation**
   - Keep README.md up to date
   - Document architecture decisions
   - Provide user guides and tutorials

## Linting and Code Quality Tools

The project uses the following tools to enforce code quality:

1. **flake8** - For style guide enforcement
2. **pylint** - For code quality analysis
3. **mypy** - For static type checking
4. **black** - For code formatting
5. **isort** - For import sorting

## Version Control Practices

1. **Commit Messages**
   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - First line is a summary (max 50 chars)
   - Followed by a blank line and detailed description if needed
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

2. **Branching Strategy**
   - `main` branch for stable releases
   - `develop` branch for ongoing development
   - Feature branches named `feature/<feature-name>`
   - Bugfix branches named `bugfix/<bug-description>`

3. **Pull Requests**
   - All changes must go through pull requests
   - Pull requests must pass all automated checks
   - Pull requests require at least one code review
