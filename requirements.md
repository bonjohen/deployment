- Should support macOS for development environments
- Must be compatible with Python 3.7 and newer
- Should work with different versions of Nginx and PostgreSQL
- Must support both IPv4 and IPv6 environments

## User Interface Requirements

### 1. Command Line Interface

- Must provide a comprehensive CLI with clear commands
- Must support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Must implement --help for all commands
- Should support command completion in common shells
- Must provide verbose output option for debugging
- Should support configuration via command line arguments and config files

### 2. Web Interface (Phase 3)

- Must provide a dashboard for monitoring application status
- Must include configuration management capabilities
- Must implement user authentication and authorization
- Should display system health metrics
- Must provide update management interface
- Should include responsive design for mobile devices

## Documentation Requirements

### 1. User Documentation

- Must include comprehensive installation guide
- Must provide troubleshooting section for common issues
- Must document all CLI commands and options
- Should include examples for common scenarios
- Must be available offline and within the application

### 2. Administrator Documentation

- Must include system architecture overview
- Must document backup and restore procedures
- Must provide security hardening guidelines
- Should include performance tuning recommendations
- Must document upgrade paths and procedures

## Integration Requirements

### 1. External Services

- Should support integration with monitoring services
- Must support email configuration for notifications
- Should provide hooks for CI/CD pipelines
- Must support integration with Let's Encrypt for SSL

### 2. API Requirements

- Should provide programmatic access to installer functions
- Must document API endpoints and usage
- Should implement proper API versioning
- Must include authentication for API access

## Development Principles and Practices

### 1. Document-Driven Development

- Must commit to document-driven development methodology
- Requirements and project plan must be updated before implementing changes
- All changes to requirements require stakeholder sign-off
- Project must always progress according to the approved plan
- Documentation must be treated as a first-class deliverable

### 2. Code Quality and Organization

- Must keep codebase clean and well-organized
- Must avoid files exceeding 200-300 lines of code; refactor when approaching this limit
- Must avoid code duplication by leveraging existing functionality
- Must write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Should follow consistent coding patterns throughout the project
- Must focus on areas of code relevant to the current task
- Must not modify code unrelated to the current task

### 3. Implementation Approach

- Must iterate on existing code patterns before creating new ones
- Must not drastically change established patterns without justification
- Must prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Must consider impact on all environments (dev, test, prod) when making changes
- Must only make changes that are explicitly requested or well understood
- Must exhaust all options within existing implementation before introducing new patterns or technologies
- Must remove old implementations when replacing with new approaches

### 4. Testing and Deployment

- Must start a new server after making changes to verify functionality
- Must kill all existing related servers before starting new ones for testing
- Must never mock data for development or production environments (only for tests)
- Must never add stubbing or fake data patterns that affect dev or prod environments
- Must never overwrite .env files without explicit confirmation
- Must consider what other methods and areas of code might be affected by changes

### 5. Environment Management

- Must support distinct configurations for development, testing, and production
- Must provide clear separation between environment-specific code
- Must document environment setup procedures for each environment
- Should automate environment configuration where possible
